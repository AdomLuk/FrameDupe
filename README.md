# FrameDupe
Plugin that allows for items to be duplicated when removing them from an item frame (based on probability).
The probability of the items being duped can be changed in the config.yml file.
Please note that this is NOT the owner, i've just wanted to update the plugin for newer versions.
In order to download, DO NOT download the source code, download the jar file in the releases!
Another note: This is version specific, if you download 1.17 framedupe for a 1.18 server or a 1.16 and below server, it will fail and not work, so if you have a 1.18 server, you download the 1.18 framedupe not anything below or above server version!
Having issues? Create an issue on github and i'll sort it out! If you want 1.11 and below framedupe! Contact me on discord: Adom#8587
